# phsmap_rendering_engine_2
* This is a new, SVG based rendering engine for the PHS Interactive Map. This repo exists in case anyone wants to embed an interactive map of PHS (i.e. people doing their client projects) without having to write all their code from scratch. 

* You can also create your own SVG-based maps and display them using this phsmap_rendering_engine_2, which is especially helpful if your map in isn't based on real-world geography (under which case you would likely benefit from an online GIS platform more)

* Docs will be available soon.

* If you were looking for the features/landmarks dataset for Poolesville High, you're not going to find it here. Contact Charles Hu (130713@mcpsmd.net) for that information.
